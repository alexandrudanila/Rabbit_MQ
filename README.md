# RabbitMQ Docker Container with HTTPS and Nginx Proxy

This project involves creating a Docker container for RabbitMQ, running over HTTPS using a Let's Encrypt certificate for secure communication. Additionally, Nginx is configured as a reverse proxy on the host to route traffic to the RabbitMQ container.

## Description

This project utilizes **Docker Compose** to set up and configure a RabbitMQ container, which is accessible via HTTPS. The SSL certificate for encrypting the traffic is automatically generated by **Let's Encrypt**. Furthermore, the Nginx server acts as a reverse proxy to secure and route traffic between clients and the RabbitMQ container.

### Components:
- **RabbitMQ**: A messaging service that allows applications to communicate via message queues.
- **Nginx**: A web server acting as a reverse proxy, routing traffic securely to RabbitMQ.
- **Docker Compose**: Used to define and launch the containerized applications, making it easier to manage the RabbitMQ and Nginx configurations in a single configuration file.

### Features:
- RabbitMQ accessible via HTTPS.
- Automatic SSL certificate generation using Let's Encrypt.
- Nginx configured as a reverse proxy to route traffic to RabbitMQ.
- Easy and quick setup with Docker Compose.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandrudanila/Rabbit_MQ.git
